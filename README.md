This project is for extending hirehop, I start with a new interface that works great to scan for check out on phones.
I will also add functionality to check in equipment and add other features.

For now you should only use it on your local firewalled network because there is no authentication whatsoever, that is something that I will add but wanted to get the basics to work first.
